# Goodbye my old friend

Its been a good run. I dont know how many API request I've made and I will always
remember that I created my first API Schema tests in Postman.

## Why

The app itself isnt discontinued or dead at all and I would say it's still a good app if
it fit your purpose. But it longer fits me.

Ever since they moved on to force me to login to save my collections and not just have a minimal client, I felt that I needed to start looking for an alternative. Sure the save in cloud might be great for many organisations, but when Im both coding on my couch after work and working with clients during workhours I want to work with them locally only and store them in my git repos. That gives me the control, where they are saved and my client having control and ownership.

And lets face it, I want a fast and easy setup, install application and run my requests.

Sure I can run collections without an account through the CLI but I always worked in Postman Client to create my collections and Im now having to opt-out from using it due to data being stored in the cloud when I login.

NOTE: I understand that companies need money and I wouldnt have had an issue with paying for a license to use the client. It's the forcing me to login and auto store on the cloud that gives me the ick.

## Alternative

### Bruno

I work a lot in VSCode so I've found [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/) to be a good alternative for me since I can install the Bruno extension in VSCode. They also have a standalone client but the extension is right now good enough for me.

They even have a Postman vs Bruno page on their website:
[Bruno vs Postman](https://www.usebruno.com/compare/bruno-vs-postman)

And I got to admit, it makes me giggle a bit that the command to run tests are
`bru run` . Everytime Im thinking `Bruh` in my head.

## Goodbye

Goodbye my friend and teacher, we've had a good few years and some part of me still hopes that you listen to your dev community and stop forcing us to login and store on cloud.
